<h1><span class="sp1">SPIES DIE HARD!</span></h1>

<h2><i>By Arnold Marmor</i></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"This</span> man is a spy for
Earth," a voice droned,
as the telecaster vibrated
and a photo of Harry Horn flashed
on the screen. "Ten thousand
credits for this man, dead or alive.
Contact Lazar of the Security
Police. Harry Horn. Thirty-four,
five feet, eleven inches, one
hundred and seventy-two pounds."</p>

<p>Lynn Brickel snapped off the
humming machine. She frowned.
Horn had been high in the Martian
Security Police, one of Lazar's
top men. Now Horn turned out
to be a spy for Earth. Why hadn't
she been told? Was Green losing
his trust in her? Hadn't she
helped McLean and Sanderson
escape from Mars?</p>

<p>Her short tunic shimmered as
she began to pace the floor. She
stopped short as a hum splashed
through the room. She went quickly
to the door and pressed a red
button on the wall.</p>

<p>But the vibration of the elevator
did not reach her ears. Puzzled,
she opened the door, stepped into
the marble hall. She shrugged,
started to return to her apartment
when the sound of footsteps on
the stairs halted her. She waited.</p>

<p>He came into view. Harry Horn.
There was no mistaking his face.
It had flashed on and off the
telecaster throughout the day.</p>

<p>"Brickel?" he said, coming up
to her.</p>

<p>His white coveralls were spotted
with grime. There was a dark
bruise on his right cheek.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said.</p>

<p>"I'm Harry Horn."</p>

<p>"I know."</p>

<p>"You've got to help me." His
voice was urgent, pleading. He
brushed past her, into her room.
She walked in after him, shut and
locked the door, leaned her back
against it.</p>

<p>"You can't stay here," she said.</p>

<p>"Are you alone?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. "I'm alone."</p>

<p>He went through the apartment,
returned to the front room. "I
had to make sure." He sank into
the low divan, covered his face
with his hands.</p>

<p>She walked toward him. "You
can't stay here," she repeated.</p>

<p>He looked up at her, his eyes
frightened. "Do you have any
idea of what Lazar will do to me
once he gets his fat hands around
my throat? He won't kill me right
away."</p>

<p>"Why come to me?"</p>

<p>"You can help me."</p>

<p>"What can I do?"</p>

<p>"You can help me get away.
A turbo-engine space ship. That's
all I need. It's small and fast."</p>

<p>"But why come to me? You
haven't explained."</p>

<p>"You helped McLean and Sanderson."</p>

<p>"How do you know this?"</p>

<p>"We're both in the same organization
but not in the same unit.
The leader of my unit instructed
me to go to you."</p>

<p>"I see. Who is your leader?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell you. You know
that. I wouldn't ask you your
leader's name."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Lynn</span> shrugged slim shoulders.
"It wouldn't make any difference.
He is not stationed on
Mars."</p>

<p>Horn jumped to his feet. "You
will help me?"</p>

<p>"If I can."</p>

<p>"Can you get me the ship?"</p>

<p>"I suppose. But we'll have to
wait for night. It is dangerous to
do anything now. Ten thousand
credits. Lazar wants you awful
bad. He offered five for both
McLean and Sanderson."</p>

<p>"I was very close to Lazar in
the Security Police. I know too
much."</p>

<p>"We all make mistakes."</p>

<p>"I envy your logic. But I can't
see it that way. I was considered
too good an agent to make a mistake."</p>

<p>"It's too late to cry over it now.
When it is dark I'll contact&mdash;a
friend&mdash;and have the space ship
ready."</p>

<p>Horn grinned. "You're still not
sure of me?"</p>

<p>"It isn't that. But you don't
belong to my unit. We can't name
names to outsiders."</p>

<p>"You're right, of course. You've
been well trained."</p>

<p>"Are you hungry?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>She set food in front of him and
watched him eat.</p>

<p>"What is Lazar like?" she asked.
"I have heard of him."</p>

<p>"Cruel," he said. "A sadist.
Death is the easy way out when
you're in Lazar's hands."</p>

<p>"It will soon be dark," she said.</p>

<p>He stood up, his hunger satisfied.
"Tell me," he said, "was it
difficult getting Sanderson and
McLean out of Mars?"</p>

<p>"No," she said. "Not difficult at
all."</p>

<p>"Good." He went to the interphone.
He dialed, spoke, "You
may come up now."</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" her face
paled.</p>

<p>He turned to her, smiling. "Lazar
was wondering how Sanderson
and McLean escaped. You were on
the master list of suspects. I was
waiting for you to confess."</p>

<p>Lynn stiffened. "It&mdash;it was a
trick."</p>

<p>"That's right, Brickel. Too bad.
You're too pretty to die."</p>

<p>"That&mdash;that was a message to
Lazar."</p>

<p>"Yes. He'll be here shortly."</p>

<p>Lynn slipped her hand in the
pocket of her tunic, brought out a
small blaster.</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool," Horn said.
"Maybe you'll be spared. Why take
your life? Just tell all you know?"</p>

<p>Lynn smiled. "I wasn't thinking
of taking my life. But yours."</p>

<p>Horn frowned. "Don't be an idiot."
He advanced toward her.</p>

<p>Lynn shook her head slowly. "Now
it's my turn to be clever."</p>

<p>Horn's face went wild. "You can't escape
Lazar! Listen to me&mdash;"</p>

<p>She blasted him.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Lynn</span> opened the door.</p>

<p>Lazar stood there, fat and
ugly. There were two men of the
Security Police with him.</p>

<p>"Come in," she invited.</p>

<p>They came in. She shut the
door. Lazar looked down at the
dead Harry Horn.</p>

<p>"You said dead or alive," Lynn
reminded Lazar. "You owe me
ten thousand credits."</p>

<p>"What happened?" Lazar snapped
at her. His flesh-bedded eyes
studied her.</p>

<p>"He came to me for help. I
had to bide my time. I told him
I'd help him. I was waiting for
the chance to get to you. He was
by the interphone a few minutes
ago. It was the chance I needed.
I pulled my blaster, covered him.
He made a dash for freedom so
I had to kill him."</p>

<p>"This is crazy," one of the men
said. "Horn must have had her
confession. But now what do we
do for evidence?"</p>

<p>"Shut up!" Lazar snapped.</p>

<p>"Your word is good, isn't it,
Lazar?" Lynn said.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"The ten thousand credits. As
a loyal citizen I've earned them."</p>

<p>"You'll get your credits," Lazar
snarled, frustration in his eyes.</p>

<p>"I know I will," Lynn said, smiling.</p>
